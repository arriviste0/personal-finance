Based on the error message, it seems like the NextAuth.js client is trying to fetch data but receiving HTML instead of the expected JSON. This often happens when the API endpoint is not configured correctly or is returning an error page.

Here's a breakdown of potential causes and fixes:

*   **Incorrect API Route Configuration:**
    *   Double-check that your NextAuth.js API routes are set up correctly within the `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` (or `.ts`) file.
    *   Verify that the `NextAuth` function is correctly handling requests and returning a JSON response.
*   **Missing Environment Variables:**
    *   NextAuth.js relies on environment variables for configuration. Make sure the required variables (like `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `MONGODB_URI`, etc.) are set in your `.env` file. The NextAuth URL variable is deprecated you do not need it.
    *   If you recently added or changed any environment variables, restart your Next.js development server to ensure the changes are loaded.
*   **CORS Issues:**
    *   Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) problems can occur if your Next.js application is running on a different domain or port than your API endpoint.
*   **Server-Side Errors:**
    *   Inspect your server-side logs for any errors occurring within the NextAuth.js API routes.
*   **Network Issues:**
    *   Although less likely in local development, ensure that there are no network connectivity issues preventing the client from reaching the API endpoint.
*   **Middleware Interruption:**
    *   Review any custom middleware in your Next.js application (`middleware.ts` or `_middleware.js` in the `pages` directory) that might be interfering with the NextAuth.js API routes.

To provide a more specific solution, I need more context, the code for the `/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` file and also check you have installed these files.

```json
    "@next-auth/mongodb-adapter": "^1.1.3",
    "next-auth": "^4.24.7",
