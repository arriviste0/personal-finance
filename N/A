Based on the error message, it seems like the NextAuth.js client is trying to fetch data but receiving HTML instead of the expected JSON. This often happens when the API endpoint is not configured correctly or is returning an error page.

Here's a breakdown of potential causes and fixes:

1.  **Incorrect API Endpoint URL:**

    *   **Problem:** The client might be using the wrong URL when making requests to the NextAuth.js API endpoints (e.g., `/api/auth/session`, `/api/auth/signin`, `/api/auth/signout`).
    *   **Solution:** Double-check that the URLs are correct and that you are not accidentally including extra characters or typos in the URLs. Ensure the base URL for your application is correctly set if you are using environment variables.

2.  **Missing API Route Handlers:**

    *   **Problem:** The necessary API route handlers for NextAuth.js might be missing or not correctly set up in your `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js` (or `.ts`) file.
    *   **Solution:** Make sure you have the following code in your `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` file:

        ```typescript
        import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
        import { authOptions } from '@/app/api/auth/authOptions'; // Import your authOptions

        const handler = NextAuth(authOptions);

        export { handler as GET, handler as POST };

        ```

3.  **Server-Side Errors in API Route:**

    *   **Problem:** The API route handler itself (`src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`) could be throwing an error, causing it to return an HTML error page instead of JSON.
    *   **Solution:** Check the server-side logs for any errors happening in your API route handler. Debug your `authOptions` configuration (especially the `providers`, `adapter`, and `callbacks`) for any potential issues.

4.  **Incorrect `Content-Type` Header:**

    *   **Problem:** The API route might be returning a `Content-Type` header that is not set to `application/json`.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure that your API route handler sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` when returning JSON data.

5.  **Middleware Issues:**

    *   **Problem:** If you have any middleware set up, it might be interfering with the NextAuth.js API routes.
    *   **Solution:** Temporarily disable any custom middleware to see if that resolves the issue. If it does, then you'll need to adjust your middleware configuration to correctly handle the NextAuth.js API routes.

6.  **Environment Variable Issues:**

    *   **Problem:** Necessary environment variables (e.g., `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, database connection strings) might not be correctly configured or passed to the application.
    *   **Solution:** Verify that all required environment variables are set up correctly and are accessible to your Next.js application, especially in production environments.

7.  **NextAuth.js Configuration Errors:**

    *   **Problem:** There might be issues with your NextAuth.js configuration (`authOptions`), such as incorrect provider settings or database connection details.
    *   **Solution:** Carefully review your `authOptions` object and ensure that all settings are correct, especially the database adapter configuration and the authentication providers.

8.  **`next-auth` version incompatibility**

    *   **Problem:** The version of `@next-auth/mongodb-adapter` might be incompatible with the current version of `mongodb`.
    *   **Solution:** Update or downgrade `@next-auth/mongodb-adapter` or `mongodb`

9.  **Troubleshooting Steps:**

    *   **Check Network Requests:** Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the actual HTTP requests being made by NextAuth.js and the responses being returned by the API endpoints.  Look for error codes (e.g., 500, 404) and the content of the responses.
    *   **Examine Server Logs:** Check your server-side logs (e.g., console output, log files) for any errors or exceptions that are occurring in your API route handlers.
    *   **Simplify Configuration:** Try simplifying your NextAuth.js configuration to the bare minimum (e.g., using a simple credential provider without a database adapter) to see if the issue persists. This can help you isolate the source of the problem.

Because the trace does not include any of your own files, the error might be related to an env variable. Ensure the NEXTAUTH_SECRET is not missing, or invalid.
